### Added

### Changed

- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site
  to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file — the
  logging of changes.

### Removed

- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
  create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
