Alinea is a modern content management system.

- Content is stored in flat files and committed to your repository
- Content is easily queryable through an in-memory SQLite database
- Content is fully typed

## Get started

Install alinea in your project directory

```sh
npm install alinea
```

Initialize alinea's config file

```sh
npx alinea init
```

Open the dashboard to have a look around

```sh
npx alinea serve
```

[Start configuring types and fields →](https://alinea.sh/docs/configuration/intro)

## Configure

Configure alinea in `alinea.config.tsx`

````tsx
const BlogPost = alinea.type('Blog post', {
  title: alinea.text('Blog entry title'),
  body: alinea.richText('Body text')
})
````

[Type options and fields →](https://alinea.sh/docs/configuration/type)

## Query

Retrieve content fully-typed and filter, order, limit and join as needed.  
Select only the fields you need.

````tsx
import {initPages} from '@alinea/content/myWorkspace/pages.js'
const pages = initPages()
console.log(
  await pages
    .whereType('BlogPost')
    .where(post => post.author.is('Me'))
    .select(post => ({title: post.title}))
)
````

Content is available during static site generation and when server side querying.  
Content is bundled with your code and can be queried with zero network overhead.

## Deploy anywhere

Alinea supports custom backends that can be hosted as a simple Node.js process or on serverless runtimes.
